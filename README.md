# Vue-UI-Components

This repository is designed to be your first exposure into the world of VueJS. This Project is all about implementing a Social Card in VueJS.



# Project I - Social Card

<ul>
<li>We're going to break down this assignment in terms of how you should be starting to think in react. Remember that everything is a component.</li>
<li>All the files you'll need for this project are found in <code>Project-I-Social-Card/social-card/src/components</code>. You can find all the component files you should need in their respective directory. i.e. inside of the <code>HeaderComponents</code> directory you should see a few <code>.js</code> files and a <code>.css</code> file.</li>
<li>Feel free to add any files for any extra components you may feel the need to build.</li>
<li>Any of the styles you write in your respective <code>.css</code> file should be available for your the components where the <code>.css</code> file is being imported.</li>
<li>We have drawn boxes around possible areas that could be components.
<ul>
<li>The outer box will represent the <code>App.js</code> file.</li>
<li>The red box around the header could represent the <code>header</code> directory with a few nested components inside, the thumbnail image and the header content.</li>
<li>You could go so far as to break down the header content into a header and body component.</li>
<li>The next box around the social card represents the React Banner image and some copy found underneath.</li>
<li>And then of course the footer (<strong>Stretch Problem 1</strong>) which contains your icons, could be a container for all of your icon components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
