# Vue-UI-Components

This repository is designed to be your first exposure into the world of VueJS. This Project is all about implementing a Social Card in VueJS.



# Project I - Social Card
We're going to break down this assignment in terms of how you should be starting to think in react. Remember that everything is a component.
All the files you'll need for this project are found in Project-I-Social-Card/social-card/src/components. You can find all the component files you should need in their respective directory. i.e. inside of the HeaderComponents directory you should see a few .js files and a .css file.
Feel free to add any files for any extra components you may feel the need to build.
Any of the styles you write in your respective .css file should be available for your the components where the .css file is being imported.
We have drawn boxes around possible areas that could be components.
The outer box will represent the App.js file.
The red box around the header could represent the header directory with a few nested components inside, the thumbnail image and the header content.
You could go so far as to break down the header content into a header and body component.
The next box around the social card represents the React Banner image and some copy found underneath.
And then of course the footer (Stretch Problem 1) which contains your icons, could be a container for all of your icon components.
